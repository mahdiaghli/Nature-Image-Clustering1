# Nature-Image-Clustering1
Academic Project – Intelligent Computing Fundamentals
Ferdowsi University of Mashhad

📌 Overview
This project focuses on unsupervised clustering of satellite images representing natural landscapes (e.g., desert, forest, beach, etc.) based on handcrafted visual features. It was developed entirely from scratch without using pre-trained models or built-in clustering evaluators.

🚀 Key Features
Feature Extraction

Dominant color detection

Texture and edge density analysis

Statistical descriptors (mean, variance, etc.)

Feature Selection

Correlation matrix computation

Threshold-based filtering to reduce redundancy

Clustering Algorithms

KMeans

DBSCAN

Agglomerative Clustering

MeanShift

All tuned manually for optimal performance

Evaluation

Self-implemented precision, recall, F1-score

Silhouette Score

Visualization

Cluster heatmaps

Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) for 2D plotting

Test Prediction

Classifies unseen data into trained clusters

Saves output as CSV
